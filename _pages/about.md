<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) and [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). I am co-supervised by [Feng Zhao](https://en.auto.ustc.edu.cn/2021/0616/c26828a513169/page.htm), [Bo Dai](https://daibo.info/), and [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/). Previously, I obtained my B.Eng. degree at [SGG](http://main.sgg.whu.edu.cn/) of Wuhan University in 2023. 

My research interest lies in the field of 3D Computer Vision, particularly neural rendering for large-scale scenes.
